#Welcome to greenFish!
Creators: Chris Brooks, Ellie BirBeck, Ian Garrett, and Molly Steelhammer<br>
  greenFish is a team building web app that allows instructors of a CIS 422 class form ideal teams. The instructor sets the priority of each question, then provides their students with the form ID and after there are enough submissions the instructor can run the match making algorithm and sort the class into teams of a given ideal size.
##Summary of Design
  The data storage is made up of three databases: instuctor accounts, courses/forms, and student responses. The server then connects the database by gathering data into easy to use chunks of information and sends it, when requested to all of our html pages. All html pages send some information to the server and recieve information as well.
